This upswing has led to new debates over how, where, and when street vending should be allowed. Using evidence from three research projects, this article examines three assumptions that underlie discussions about street vending regulations—that extensive regulations are necessary to (1) protect property interests, (2) prevent pedestrian congestion or other impacts, and (3) keep the street orderly. The findings suggest that fewer regulations are needed to meet legitimate public purposes, and cities would benefit from a new approach in which they reduced street vending regulations and actively planned to enhance compatibility with other urban activities.},

Gibson-Graham and supporters regarding how people make a living outside the capitalist framework, lists street vendors and informal economies of the global South as potential components. This article critiques the relevance of this vision for street vendor livelihoods in a politically socialist locale, albeit one embracing neo-liberal modernity. In their drive to create a modern, ‘civilised’ capital, Vietnam’s central government and Hanoi’s municipal authorities have a particular image of security, orderliness and development. Street vendors disrupt this picture and since 2008 have been negotiating a ban in many preferred locales. Building upon urban livelihoods, everyday politics and resistance concepts, an analysis is made of in-depth interviews with itinerant and fixed-stall vendors to unravel their heterogeneous responses to such revanchist policies. Despite subtle covert and overt resistance tactics, the study reveals that celebrated ‘community economies’ and alternative economic visions remain rare in this context.},

For this aim, a survey was conducted during the month of February 2007 in Yogyakarta and Sleman districts in Yogyakarta Special Province. The survey covered 122 street vendors in several streets in both areas. These samples consist of three groups of street vendors: food seller, non-food seller, and services providers. Based on this survey, vulnerability index of street vendors is measured. The study found that most of street vendors in Yogyakarta experience vulnerability at the medium level. In general, vulnerability of food seller vendors is higher than other vendors. Vulnerability also varies across the locations of vending.},

A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 198 vendors who were selected using multi-stage TimeLocation Sampling procedures from six street vending cluster sites and included the itinerant vendors in the city. Data were analysed using Dabir-Alai’s (Dabir-Alai, 2004) and Brata’s (Brata, 2010) vulnerability analysis frameworks; but with little modification. This study; however, departs from the above two as it included more elements of vulnerability, has used descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation to determine the level of vulnerability and inferential statistics i.e. Chi-Squares to test whether vulnerability is associated with some physical, demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics of vendors. The results showed that vulnerability was higher for street vendors as higher proportion of vendors lay on the high end of the spectrum of vulnerability. However, it was varied with sex, type of goods vended, frequency of attendance of vending cluster sites and type of goods; but, not with the location of vending. At the end, the article discusses the need for proper understanding of vulnerability of vendors and implementation of inclusive and participatory approaches in management and governance of urban public spaces upon which the livelihoods of vendors largely depend in the city.},

Recent research, however, has emphasized the role of the state in constructing vendors’ informal status and has documented local government practices that take advantage of an ambiguous legal environment for vendors. These practices include low-level harassment, merchandise confiscations, and arbitrary evictions. This article examines the regulatory spaces through which local government officials have developed these informal practices and documents the extent to which street vendors and market traders experience them in five cities: Accra, Ghana; Ahmedabad, India; Durban, South Africa; Lima, Peru; and Nakuru, Kenya. The article then identifies three components of legal reform used in Ahmedabad, Durban, and Lima to counter those practices: (1) establishing limits on municipal power, (2) linking street vending to poverty alleviation, and (3) establishing channels for street vendors’ representation. The findings suggest ways in which cities can more effectively balance the right to livelihood with the need to govern public space.},

The goal of this paper is to illustrate how the informal economy, through the case study of informal street vendors, does not operate on the margins of society in a "third world" context, but plays an active role in the formal economy. The recent literature on the informal economy is used to provide a theoretical context on the interrelationship between the informal and formal economies. The primary data for this project came from nine months of participant observation field research of informal street vendors peddling in a "vendors' market" on Fourteenth Street. The research presented in this paper identifies three general types of informal peddling activities in the 14th Street vendors' market: mobile vendors, stoopline stands, and poachers. Three distinct connections between the informal vendors and the formal economy are documented by researching the day-to-day activities of the street vendors that peddle on Fourteenth Street. The paper strives to illustrate the complex nature of informal street peddling and how it relates to the formal economy in order to highlight some of the positive benefits associated with informal activities.},

Constitutional challenges to municipal regulations have paved the way for the incorporation of municipal regulations based on a right to work on the streets. This article seeks to understand and explain how the act of placing a wooden or metal stall over a public space contributes to the development of a regulatory regime that administrates the right to work in an urban space. It further shows how these solutions have been jeopardized by litigation and transformed by recent constitutional doctrines that recognize the right to work on streets. Constitutional courts in Mexico, Colombia, and India have addressed the struggles between the street vendors’ ability to work on public thoroughfare and the municipal regulations that seek to limit street trading. As such, our aim is to analyze the way in which the municipal capacity to legislate, control, and regulate public space has been challenged and constrained by street vendors’ invocation of their right to work in these countries. This will help explain how constitutional courts do actually represent urban governance.},

	abstract = {The well-documented weaknesses of structural adjustment policies have led to a reconceptualisation of the World Bank's approach to neo-liberal reforms. The 'Doing Business' reforms aim to foster a better climate for business in a number of ways. The main policy documents reject interventions targeted at specific groups but, although they identify informal small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as likely to benefit disproportionately, they specifically exclude micro-enterprises as a target group. The general argument of this paper is that reforms may well impact non-target groups through interactions with several areas of policy and law, with public attitudes and with multiple economic sectors. In particular, it is argued that the exclusion of micro-traders from the reforms contributes to their marginalisation in political and policy arenas, increasing their vulnerability to state intervention. The paper draws on a four-month study conducted by the authors in Tanzania in 2007.},

	abstract = {This article assesses the motivations for participation in the informal economy in general and street vending in particular and explores vendors’ livelihood dynamics in Dire Dawa city, Eastern Ethiopia. Data were collected from fixed and itinerant vendors who were found vending a variety of goods and services in the city during data collection. A descriptive survey design was employed in this study. Time location sampling procedure – a new method of two-stage sampling that has been widely used to select the hard-to-reach segment of society – was employed to select 198 street vendors. Data were collected using a questionnaire survey, in-depth interviews and observation during 2016/17. The study revealed that the majority of vendors report that they engaged in street vending for survival. But some consider it is an opportunity for income, employment and growth, and livelihood improvement in the city. The majority of vendors indicated that there have been improvements in their lives since they started vending. Thus, this study points to the need to employ multiple perspectives to capture the reality underneath livelihoods in the informal economy. Policy approaches that recognise the vitality of public spaces for street vending activities, the integrality of vendors to the socio-economic fabric of the city, and their modest contributions to the socio-economic development of the city are necessary.},

	abstract = {Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic affects human health and the global economy. Its evolution is unpredictable, making it hard for governments to provide response actions suited for all populations. Meanwhile, informal street workers carry on with their labor despite contingency measures to sustain their lives. The objective was to conduct a case-control study to become aware of how street vendors' economy is affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methodology: During phase 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic in a Mexican suburban city. We interviewed informal street vendors (cases) and formal employees (controls).
Results: Before mobility restrictions were in place, population income came 1.5\% from formal employment and 23.5\% from informal employment (street vendors). Informal employees lived on less than the equivalent of 1.5 Big Macs per day (p {\textless}0.001). After the contingency measures, formal employment kept the same, while the informal employment ratio increased to 57.4\% (p {\textless} 0.001). The street vendors were almost 100-times less likely to be concerned about the coronavirus outbreak (p {\textless} 0.001) and were 38-times less likely to stop working compared with the formal workers (p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions: We have proven that street vendors are a sector of the population that is highly vulnerable to significant economic loss due to contingency measures. Informal workers cannot stop working despite the “Stay at Home” initiative because the government has not implemented strategies that guarantee their survival and their families. Therefore, street vendors continue to be a source of the virus's spread throughout cities.},

We extend the previous analysis of the informal economy in one city, Cali, Colombia, with data on informal workers in two public spaces: Downtown and Santa Helena, and workers in the mass transit bus system. We show how the informal economy varies greatly within one city. Provided the lack of data in the study of the informal economy, most studies describe the dynamics of the informal sector as uniform across the urban space. In this analysis, we present evidence about the spatial segmentation and diversity of street vendors by their socioeconomic conditions, proﬁts, and earnings. We further explore the spatial segmentation by analyzing the large indebtedness and ﬁnancial exclusion of street vendors. We report that workers in the mass transit system are the most vulnerable and indebted and how the large indebtedness to illegal payday lenders is a major barrier for street vendors to move out of poverty. We conclude that it is important to understand the granularity of the urban informal economy in order to craft suitable public policies.},

	abstract = {This collaborative and comparative paper deals with the impact of Covid-19 on the use and governance of public space and street trade in particular in two major African cities. The importance of street trading for urban food security and urban-based livelihoods is beyond dispute. Trading on the streets does, however, not occur in neutral or abstract spaces, but rather in livedin and contested spaces, governed by what is referred to as ‘street geographies’, evoking outbreaks of violence and repression. Vendors are subjected to the politics of municipalities and the state to modernize the socio-spatial ordering of the city and the urban food economy through restructuring, regulating, and restricting street vending. Street vendors are harassed, streets are swept clean, and hygiene standards imposed. We argue here that the everyday struggle for the street has intensified since and during the Covid-19 pandemic. Mobility and the use of urban space either being restricted by the city-state or being defended and opened up by street traders, is common to the situation in Harare and Kisumu. Covid-19, we pose, redefines, and creates ‘new’ street geographies. These geographies pivot on agency and creativity employed by street trade actors while navigating the lockdown measures imposed by state actors. Traders navigate the space or room for manoeuvre they create for themselves, but this space unfolds only temporarily, opens for a few only and closes for most of the street traders who become more uncertain and vulnerable than ever before, irrespective of whether they are licensed, paying rents for vending stalls to the city, or ‘illegally’ vending on the street.},

However, the formal and informal sectors do not contribute equally to the national GDP, with over 80\% of this total originating from the informal sector. Street vending, among other informal activities in India, is a vital contributor to the informal economy. Many scholars argue that despite the critical influence of physical urban patterns on the practicability and viability of informal activities, urban planners are not providing adequate urban planning policies. Bangalore, the third largest Indian city by population, is the subject of the present case study. Although this city hosts a wide variety of cultures, economies, and lifestyles, 74\% of its population can be categorized as working in the informal sector. The goals of this research study are (a) to explore spatial planning in relation to the urban informal sector in Central Bangalore, (b) to identify the physical urban challenges experienced by the city’s street vendors, and (c) to examine the implications of these challenges for the city’s master plan. Through interviews, surveys, and site analysis (mapping), This study elucidates (a) the challenges experienced by the area’s stakeholders (i.e., vendors and buyers), (b) the limited planning of the spatial urban form by urban planners with regard to the accommodation of informal economic activities, and accordingly, (c) the need to implement spatial planning policies and design regulations appropriate to Bangalore’s high-density marketplace.},

Data were collected from fixed and itinerant vendors who were found vending a variety of goods and services in the city during data collection. A descriptive survey design was employed in this study. Time location sampling procedure – a new method of two-stage sampling that has been widely used to select the hard-to-reach segment of society – was employed to select 198 street vendors. Data were collected using a questionnaire survey, in-depth interviews and observation during 2016/17. The study revealed that the majority of vendors report that they engaged in street vending for survival. But some consider it is an opportunity for income, employment and growth, and livelihood improvement in the city. The majority of vendors indicated that there have been improvements in their lives since they started vending. Thus, this study points to the need to employ multiple perspectives to capture the reality underneath livelihoods in the informal economy. Policy approaches that recognise the vitality of public spaces for street vending activities, the integrality of vendors to the socio-economic fabric of the city, and their modest contributions to the socio-economic development of the city are necessary.},

	abstract = {Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic affects human health and the global economy. Its evolution is unpredictable, making it hard for governments to provide response actions suited for all populations. Meanwhile, informal street workers carry on with their labor despite contingency measures to sustain their lives. The objective was to conduct a case-control study to become aware of how street vendors' economy is affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methodology: During phase 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic in a Mexican suburban city. We interviewed informal street vendors (cases) and formal employees (controls).
Results: Before mobility restrictions were in place, population income came 1.5\% from formal employment and 23.5\% from informal employment (street vendors). Informal employees lived on less than the equivalent of 1.5 Big Macs per day (p {\textless}0.001). After the contingency measures, formal employment kept the same, while the informal employment ratio increased to 57.4\% (p {\textless} 0.001). The street vendors were almost 100-times less likely to be concerned about the coronavirus outbreak (p {\textless} 0.001) and were 38-times less likely to stop working compared with the formal workers (p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions: We have proven that street vendors are a sector of the population that is highly vulnerable to significant economic loss due to contingency measures. Informal workers cannot stop working despite the “Stay at Home” initiative because the government has not implemented strategies that guarantee their survival and their families. Therefore, street vendors continue to be a source of the virus's spread throughout cities.},

We extend the previous analysis of the informal economy in one city, Cali, Colombia, with data on informal workers in two public spaces: Downtown and Santa Helena, and workers in the mass transit bus system. We show how the informal economy varies greatly within one city. Provided the lack of data in the study of the informal economy, most studies describe the dynamics of the informal sector as uniform across the urban space. In this analysis, we present evidence about the spatial segmentation and diversity of street vendors by their socioeconomic conditions, proﬁts, and earnings. We further explore the spatial segmentation by analyzing the large indebtedness and ﬁnancial exclusion of street vendors. We report that workers in the mass transit system are the most vulnerable and indebted and how the large indebtedness to illegal payday lenders is a major barrier for street vendors to move out of poverty. We conclude that it is important to understand the granularity of the urban informal economy in order to craft suitable public policies.},

	abstract = {Street vending is one of the most important economic activities of the informal sector. This paper highlights the diversity of street vending. We extend the previous analysis of the informal economy in one city, Cali, Colombia, with data on informal workers in two public spaces: Downtown and Santa Helena, and workers in the mass transit bus system. We show how the informal economy varies greatly within one city. Provided the lack of data in the study of the informal economy, most studies describe the dynamics of the informal sector as uniform across the urban space. In this analysis, we present evidence about the spatial segmentation and diversity of street vendors by their socioeconomic conditions, proﬁts, and earnings. We further explore the spatial segmentation by analyzing the large indebtedness and ﬁnancial exclusion of street vendors. We report that workers in the mass transit system are the most vulnerable and indebted and how the large indebtedness to illegal payday lenders is a major barrier for street vendors to move out of poverty. We conclude that it is important to understand the granularity of the urban informal economy in order to craft suitable public policies.},

	abstract = {This collaborative and comparative paper deals with the impact of Covid-19 on the use and governance of public space and street trade in particular in two major African cities. The importance of street trading for urban food security and urban-based livelihoods is beyond dispute. Trading on the streets does, however, not occur in neutral or abstract spaces, but rather in livedin and contested spaces, governed by what is referred to as ‘street geographies’, evoking outbreaks of violence and repression. Vendors are subjected to the politics of municipalities and the state to modernize the socio-spatial ordering of the city and the urban food economy through restructuring, regulating, and restricting street vending. Street vendors are harassed, streets are swept clean, and hygiene standards imposed. We argue here that the everyday struggle for the street has intensified since and during the Covid-19 pandemic. Mobility and the use of urban space either being restricted by the city-state or being defended and opened up by street traders, is common to the situation in Harare and Kisumu. Covid-19, we pose, redefines, and creates ‘new’ street geographies. These geographies pivot on agency and creativity employed by street trade actors while navigating the lockdown measures imposed by state actors. Traders navigate the space or room for manoeuvre they create for themselves, but this space unfolds only temporarily, opens for a few only and closes for most of the street traders who become more uncertain and vulnerable than ever before, irrespective of whether they are licensed, paying rents for vending stalls to the city, or ‘illegally’ vending on the street.},

	abstract = {Informal work has received much attention in global policy and research over the past four decades, however, policy approaches have favoured an economic way of thinking about informality rather than a spatial or urban perspective. This article investigates city-scale trends within the informal food economy of Bengaluru, attempting to use a spatial lens to understand informal work. The study involved a large scale quantitative survey of informal food businesses in different kinds of neighborhoods across the city, as well as in-depth interviews with a smaller set of businesses. Through the survey and interviews, we studied the variety of business setups and their operations, occupational mobility and financial stability. This article attempts to demonstrate: (i) the di­ versity of outcomes for vendors over time, and (ii) how vendors' occupational history and social networks play a role in creating (and closing off) vending opportunities, and (iii) how the spatial-economic structure of the city, defined here as specific land typologies, influences the operations and financial prospects of informal food businesses.},
